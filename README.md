TwitchTurtle
======
## Integrate TurtleCoin with StreamLabs
Note: This is works with Twitch and Youtube Live

# This project is deprecated and replaced with a web only version at https://twitchturtle.com . This program no longer works and should only be used as an example

### Basic installation

* Download the new release from https://github.com/Watt3r/TwitchTurtle/releases/ 
* Change the settings in settings.ini with any text editor
* Run main.exe
* While you are streaming, you need to keep main.exe open



#### Building from Source

* Clone or Download this Git repository onto your local machine
* Check to see if you have python already installed, you can check with `python --version` or `python3 --version` You must have python 3.6.5 or higher to work.
* If the command above worked when you had a 3 added to the end of python, you must add that for all steps, with `python` and `pip` so they look like `python3` and `pip3`
* Open terminal or cmd and go to the TwitchTurtle folder and enter `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Open the `settings.ini` with your favorite editor, and change the password and username.
* Then, run `python main.py` while in the TwitchTurtle folder.
* (Optional) if you want to make the python file into an .exe, run the build.bat file and it will build it into the `dist` folder.
