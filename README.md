## Integrate TurtleCoin with StreamLabs


#### Installation Process

* Clone or Download this Git repository onto your local machine
* Check to see if you have python already installed, you can check with `python --version` or `python3 --version` You must have python 3.6.5 or higher to work.
* If the command above worked when you had a 3 added to the end of python, you must add that for all steps, with `python` and `pip` so they look like `python3` and `pip3`
* Open terminal or cmd and go to the TwitchTurtle folder and enter `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Open the `settings.py` from the script subfolder with your favorite editor, and change the values to what you feel is best.
* Then, run `python main.py` while in the TwitchTurtle folder.

#### How to use

* After the first time running, you should just need to run `python main.py` while in the TwitchTurtle folder.
* If you want to take the TurtleCoin out of your donation wallet and into a new one, (which is highly recomended) download [box-turtle from here](https://github.com/watt3r/box-turtle)
